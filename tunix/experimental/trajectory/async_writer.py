class AsyncWriter(abc.ABC, Generic[_TaskT]):
  """Abstract asynchronous queue writer managing worker thread lifecycle.

  Architectural Decisions & Invariants:
    1. Single Dedicated Background Worker Thread:
       A single background daemon thread processes write tasks sequentially
       from a bounded FIFO queue (`queue.Queue`). Using a single sequential
       worker ensures chronological order per entity without requiring complex
       per-record locking, while keeping memory and thread overhead minimal in
       distributed training environments.

    2. Bounded Queue Capacity with Metadata Reserve:
       To prevent unbounded memory growth or caller-thread blocking during
       storage latency spikes, the queue enforces a hard capacity of
       `max_queue_size`:
         - Step tasks (`task.step is not None`) are admitted below
           `step_queue_limit` (90% of `max_queue_size`) and dropped
           non-blockingly with a warning once `step_queue_limit` is reached.
         - Metadata-only tasks (`task.step is None`) may use the remaining 10%
           reserve up to `max_queue_size` so parent trajectory records and
           final episode statuses are preserved when step writes fill the
           queue. At `max_queue_size`, all incoming tasks are dropped
           non-blockingly with a warning.

    3. Lazy Worker Thread Initialization:
       The worker thread is not spawned during `__init__`. Instead, it is
       lazily initialized under a thread lock on the first enqueue operation.
       This prevents unnecessary OS thread allocation in read-only processes.

    4. Best-Effort Fault Tolerance:
       Persistence errors (e.g. disk full, transient network database errors)
       must never crash distributed training loops. The worker loop catches all
       task processing exceptions, logs them with full tracebacks via
       `_log_task_error`, and continues draining subsequent tasks. Errors are
       suppressed and never propagated back to callers or `flush()`.

    5. Strict Barrier Synchronization:
       `flush()` blocks on `_queue.join()`. When `flush()` returns, all tasks
       enqueued prior to the call are guaranteed to have completed execution.

    6. Safe Lifecycle & Shutdown Hook:
       `close()` enqueues a sentinel None task, joins the worker thread with a
       configurable timeout, and deregisters from `_LIVE_WRITERS`. The `atexit`
       hook drains all live instances when the interpreter exits.
