"""Lifecycle driver for bringing a fleet of workers up and down.

Sequences the `Worker` lifecycle (`initialize` -> `compile` -> `start`) across
an
entire registry, phase by phase, so every worker finishes one phase before the
next begins (e.g. all compiles happen before any worker starts serving).
Shutdown is best-effort: every worker gets a `stop()` even if an earlier one
raised, and the collected failures are reported together.
