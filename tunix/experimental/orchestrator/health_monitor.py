"""Health monitor with per-state deadlines for the control plane.

Polls each worker's `heartbeat()` and tracks how long it has been in its current
coarse state. Transient states (e.g. COMPILING, SYNCING, DRAINING) carry a
deadline; a worker that dwells past its state's deadline is reported as overdue
so the orchestrator can fence or fail it. Steady states (e.g. READY) have no
deadline. Time comes from an injectable monotonic clock so the policy is
testable without sleeping.
